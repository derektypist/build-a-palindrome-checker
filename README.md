# Build A Palindrome Checker

A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case and spacing.  All non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, symbols and spaces) will be removed and everything is turned to lower case in order to check for palindromes.

## UX

**Getting Started**

Enter text in the input field and click on the Check button.  You will see if your entered text is a palindrome, unless you do not enter anything in the input field.

**User Stories**

1.  As a user, I expect an `input` element with an `id` of `text-input`.

2.  As a user, I expect a `button` element with `id` of `check-btn`.

3.  As a user, I expect a `div` element with `id` of `result`.

4.  As a user, when I click on the `#check-btn`
