# Build A Palindrome Checker

A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case and spacing.  All non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, symbols and spaces) will be removed and everything is turned to lower case in order to check for palindromes.

## UX

**Getting Started**

Enter text in the input field and click on the Check button.  You will see if your entered text is a palindrome, unless you do not enter anything in the input field.

**User Stories**

(Taken from FreeCodeCamp - Build a Palindrome Checker Project)

1.  As a user, I expect an `input` element with an `id` of `text-input`.

2.  As a user, I expect a `button` element with `id` of `check-btn`.

3.  As a user, I expect a `div` element with `id` of `result`.

4.  As a user, when I click on the `#check-btn` element without entering a value into the `#text-input` element, an alert should appear with the text `Please enter a value`.

5.  As a user, when the `#text-input` element only contains the letter `A` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, I expect the `#result` element should contain the text `A is a palindrome`.

6.  As a user, when the `#text-input` element contains the text `eye` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, I expect the `#result` element should contain the text `eye is a palindrome`.

7.  As a user, when the `#text-input` element contains the text `_eye` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, I expect the `#result` element should contain the text `_eye is a palindrome`.

8.  As a user, when the `#text-input` element contains the text `race car` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, I expect the `#result` element should contain the text `race car is a palindrome`.

9.  As a user, when the `#text-input` element contains the text `not a palindrome` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, I expect the `#result` element should contain the text `not a palindrome is not a palindrome`.

10.  As a user, when the `#text-input` element contains the text `A man, a plan, a canal. Panama` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, I expect the `#result` element should contain the text `A man, a plan, a canal. Panama is a palindrome`.

11.  As a user, when the `#text-input` element contains the text `never odd or even` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, I expect the `#result` element should contain the `text never odd or even is a palindrome`.

12.  As a user, when the `#text-input` element contains the text `nope` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, I expect the `#result` element should contain the text `nope is not a palindrome`.

13.  As a user, when the `#text-input` element contains the text `almostomla` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, I expect the `#result` element should contain the text `almostomla is not a palindrome`.

14.  As a user, when the `#text-input` element contains the text `My age is 0, 0 si ega ym.` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, I expect the `#result` element should contain the text `My age is 0, 0 si ega ym. is a palindrome`.

15.  As a user, when the `#text-input` element contains the text `1 eye for of 1 eye.` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, I expect the `#result` element should contain the text `1 eye for of 1 eye. is not a palindrome`.

16.  As a user, when the `#text-input` element contains the text `0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, I expect the `#result` element should contain the text `0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0 is a palindrome`.

17.  As a user, when the `#text-input` element contains the text `five|\_/|four` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, I expect the `#result` element should contain the text `five|\_/|four is not a palindrome`.

## Features

Allows the user to enter text in order to check if the given word or phrase is a palindrome.  If there is no value entered in the input field, an alert is displayed.

## Technologies

Uses HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

## Testing

Ensure all user stories have been met.

## Deployment

[Live Project](https://derektypist.github.io/build-a-palindrome-checker/) is deployed on GitHub Pages, with the main branch.
