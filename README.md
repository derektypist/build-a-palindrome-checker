# build-a-palindrome-checker
A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case and spacing.  All non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, symbols and spaces) will be removed and everything is turned to lower case in order to check for palindromes.
